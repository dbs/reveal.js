                            It is still a matter of debate in some circles (AUTOCAT) as to whether
                            trying to reach users through general search engines like Google, Bing,
                            and Yahoo! is even a worthwhile goal. Information literacy classes,
                            the splendors of advanced search interfaces, etc.

                            <p>
                            A recurring topic in the library world is how we might get the
                            contents of our catalogues to show up in search engines so that regular users
                            could be pointed directly at our resources in the course of their general
                            searches. (images of twitter threads, mailing list threads, etc)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            However, at a very basic level, if someone searches for "library" on their
                            phone or laptop, you want your library to show up if they happen to be in the
                            general vicinity.

                            the data seems to be driven by Foursquare data.

                            Laurentian shows up with more information--largely because I updated it in the
                            course of my research to point at the "new" catalogue we had migrated to 5
                            years ago--but still no branch info and a bit of a conflict between ILL needs
                            and general needs of the library.

                            But even relatively static data such as operating hours can be cumbersome to
                            maintain across multiple social media sites. There has to be a better way.

                            Search engine optimization (SEO) has acquired a dirty name, by association
                            with spammers who want to sell you snake oil that will help your web site rise
                            in the ranks of relevancy. Web rings, spammy comments on blogs, and all kinds
                            of base tricks have slandered the perfectly valid pursuit of trying to make the
                            fantastic content and services you have to offer discoverable to the people who
                            might benefit from it.

                            Just like the term hackers was once a noble term associated with those who
                            were interested in how technology works and how to make it work better, then
                            spoiled by association with script kiddies and trolls who just wanted to make
                            lives miserable, we started to reclaim the term by differentiating "white hat"
                            hackers vs. "black hat" hackers. So, too, are we reclaiming the term SEO by
                            differentiating "white hat" SEO vs. "black hat" SEO.

                            In this session, I'm going to walk through some of the basics that you need
                            to look at from a white hat SEO perspective. If you have internet connectivity,
                            I invite you to take a look at your own site as I work through some of the
                            examples I've already prepared; if not, I'll do my best to make the examples
                            come alive on the screen. If at any time you have a question, please fire away.

                            This is where we talk a bit about the difference between information that
                            humans can see and interpret, versus what machines can see and interpret. At a
                            very basic level, there is a lot of overlap here with principles of information
                            design and designing for accessibility: for example:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Use meaningful HTML elements, such as headings, rather than forcing everything
                            into tables or this decade's equivalent: div/span soup. And use those headings
                            hierarchically; the H1 should be the title of the page, then H2 should be used
                            to break out separate sections of the page into major topics; then H3 should
                            subdivide the content of those major topics. If you find yourself using a lot
                            of strong/bold tags or CSS styles, maybe you just need to carve up your content
                            a little bit more.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Don't use an image where text would do. For example, don't
                            create a PNG or JPEG to use as a button that says "Enter the contest" as an
                            image; even if you add alt="Enter the contest", that's less approachable than
                            simply using "Enter the contest" as the actual text of the button.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Again, accessible information design has been the subject of many other talks.
                            Given that we're in Ontario and AODA legislation is in effect, you're all at
                            least compliant with WCAG 2.0 level A, right? Good!

                                "robots" are the affectionate name for the scripts/processes/machines that
                                crawl through websites to extract content and process it for some purpose.
                                Search engines like Google and Bing use robots to grab content from sites so
                                that they can serve up links to your pages/images/library resources in search
                                results; other robots might be interested only in product information so that
                                they can tell you the cheapest place to buy something online.

                                Robots are pretty dumb and easily confused. For example, they'll find
                                a search results page on your catalogue that lists thousands of results for the
                                term "fish" and dutifully crawl through all of the links that they find; then
                                if they find a search results page for the term "fishing" that (due to
                                stemming) returns exactly the same results, they'll dutifully crawl through all
                                of the links they find again.
                            </p>

                                often lead to results like:

                                Even though you and I have no problem guessing that the page will display the
                                same record, and that (if anything) the list of related search results might
                                change on that page without affecting the substantive content on the page, a
                                search engine has no way of being able to telling what it will find on the
                                other end of these links without human intervention.

                                That effectively tells every robot to just go away. If you don't want your
                                content to show up in search engines, that's the right thing to do--but most of
                                us are here because we wantsearch engines to expose users to the library
                                resources that we have. Note that search engines have become much smarter over
                                the past 20 years, and will dynamically adapt their crawl rate to avoid
                                bringing down your web resources… because, after all, they want to connect
                                users to the best resources on the web, and a web site that isn't running isn't
                                very much use to them.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                One other note: robots.txt only affects well-behaved robots. Again, search
                                engines like Google, Bing, and Yandex are interested in playing by the rules,
                                so if you find that your site is constantly being brought down by too much
                                traffic, it's unlikely that it's the well-behaved search engines causing the
                                problem. Setting a highly restrictive robots.txt file is more likely to just
                                block the good robots while doing nothing to prevent the bad robots from
                                continuing to pound your site.

                            a machine can easily generate on a nightly basis. And many of the content
                            management systems that websites run on either have the ability built-in, or
                            have plugins available, that will take care of generating sitemaps for you.
                            Similarly, library systems like Evergreen and VuFind offer the ability to
                            generate sitemaps for you; you just need to set it up once and forget about it.

                            track the status of the indexing of your sites, some insight into the usage of
                            your site and potential errors found at your site, and potentially influence
                            how the search engine interprets your content. Diving into those tools could be

                            HTML. It's still a bag of words to them, albeit with suggestions about what the
                            titles of various sections might be, but it can be very challenging for them to
                            determine (for example) what the right picture might be on a news page to
                            associate with the event. Google News provides lots of amusing examples of
                            machines guessing wrong.

                            <li><a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.ca/2011/06/introducing-schemaorg-search-engines.html">In July 2011</a>, schema.org was announced by the major search engines; goals were:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Offer a simple vocabulary for the most common entities on the web (events, products, people)</li>
                                    <li>Enable normal webmasters to add schema.org markup without needing Semantic Web expertise</li>
                                    <li>Help search engines aggregate data and apply finer-grained disambiguation and relevance strategies</li>

                            Recognizing that the world would benefit from a metadata vocabulary that we
                            could embed inside of web pages to provide more meaning to the machines that
                            digest those web pages, some of the major search engines (Google, Yahoo, Bing,
                            and Yandex) collaborated in 2011 to bring forward such a vocabulary, called
                            "schema.org".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Using this vocabulary, you can unambiguously identify sections of
                            your library home page that describe your library's name, address, phone
                            number, email address, opening hours, upcoming events, etc. Then search engines
                            or other automated crawlers could, when they come across this kind of markup,
                            have much more authoritative data on which to build their services.

                            First, we can use the handy "Search" box at http://schema.org/ to find out that
                            there is, indeed, an http://schema.org/Library type. Quick rule of thumb in
                            schema.org: types (that is, classes of objects that have properties to describe
                            them) start with a capital letter, while properties (that is, attributes of
                            objects) start with a lowercase letter.
                            <p>
                            </p>
                            The documentation for types in schema.org list the most specific properties for
                            a given type at the top, and then as you move down you get more generic
                            properties. In the case of Library, it inherits properties from LocalBusiness,
                            which inherits more general properties from Organization, which inherits the
                            most general properties from the top-level Thing.

                            The first thing we need to do is to tell the machines that we're going to
                            describe a Library on this HTML page. To do so, we can use microdata, RDFa, or
                            JSON-LD. Microdata and RDFa are competing but reasonably equivalent standards
                            for adding simple properties to HTML to identify markup in context, while
                            JSON-LD is JavaScript markup that appears in its own <code>script</code> tag. For now,
                            we'll use RDFa, as it is a W3C standard and, along with microdata, is still
                            most broadly recognized by search engines.

<aside class="notes">
One convention is to use the <code>&lt;body></code> element to identify the
main thing that we're marking up on an HTML page.

With RDFa, you can identify the default vocabulary in the external scope using
the @vocab attribute; and then after that, all types and properties are
automatically appended to the vocabulary URL. You use the @typeof attribute to
declare what type you are marking up. So our body tag should now look like:
