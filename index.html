            <li>Website as observable, measurable proxies for organization -
              likely to be the leading edge of change (for example, adding a
              territory acknowledgement)</li>
            <li>Website defined as including research guides, catalogue, databases,
              online chat: the web-based surface of often parallel services</li>
            <li>A longitudinal analysis of university websites shows
              increasing adoption of support for multiple languages (Callahan
              &amp; herring, 2012)</li>
            <li>University libraries have been urged to publish research guides in
              languages that support their international students (Albarillo,
              2018)</li>
            <li>Students have requested additional multilingual search options
              in the library catalogue and databases (Nzomo, Rubin, &amp;
              Ajiferuke, 2012), and vocabulary acquisition has been
              observed when students use thesauri and descriptors in the
              course of their research (Bordonaro, 2010).
            </li>
            <li>
              Libraries have been urged to act as agents of cultural change by
              rethinking the value of literary warrant, discarding the
              pretense of neutrality, and instead modifying their cataloguing
              practices to replace headings that marginalize oppressed
              communities, such as "Indians of North America", with locally
              appropriate variants (Doyle et al., 2015; Lee, 2011; Olson,
              2000) 
            </li>
            <li>
              To support multilingual access and vocabulary acquisition, the
              Xwi7wa library at the University of British Columbia pairs the
              preferred Indigneous term with a parenthetical colonial term:
              for example, “Stl’atl’imx (Lillooet)” (Doyle, Lawson, &amp;
              Dupont, 2015)
