                        <aside class="notes">
Thinking about the challenge of turning this around, and of convincing thousands of libraries and archives to adopt schema.org on just the most basic of all of their web pages, I *almost* gave up. That's a lot of inertia to overcome. But in January 2015, members of the Royal Society of Canada expert panel report on the future of libraries in Canada presented their work at the OLA SuperConference--and part of that work included a map of almost 5,000 Canadian libraries and archives. That map was an effort contributed by the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory (CWRC), and the work on the initial version wrapped up in June 2014.
<p>
I was impressed--every one had lat/long data, along with some related institutional data, including URL. For sure, there were problems: all of the lat/longs for Toronto were the same, perhaps for clustering purposes. But still!
</p>
<p>
A challenge was that it was almost entirely a manual effort, dated June 2014. And the clock continues to tick, and things continue to change, and the data continues to get more out of sync.
</p>
<p>
It drives me crazy that, despite more than 90% of the entries having URLs, we can't simply regularly crawl the sites and update and augment the data.
</p>
<p>
Which is why this summer I was delighted to meet Susan Brown, who spearheaded the CWRC effort. She recognizes the problem, understands the value of linked open data, and wants to collaborate on solutions to keeping the data fresh and relevant.

                        This meshed perfectly with my drive to connect library resources with Canadians by exposing structured data in the web pages describing those resources.

The "authoritative single source for institutional metadata" that the WorldCat Registry claims to be is missing most institutions and out of date on most of the ones that are included, and is hampered by a license that prohibits non-commercial use.

                                CWRC very generously made the data they had collected available to download on a province-by-province basis, in a simple JSON format.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So here's a typical entry of what we're starting with. The granularity of the address info is low: we're working with the city level, so the latitude and longitude doesn't really help us if we want to see the distribution of branches across a given city, but it's a starting point.   
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The crucial piece is the URL. Given a URL, you can grab the HTML for the library's home page and (perhaps!) pull some current data from it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At the very least, you can find out if the URL is still current.

Why does this matter, beyond the unfortunately abstract "linked open data enables others to build exciting new services!"? People increasingly search on mobile devices, meaning that they're getting funneled through Google, Bing, and Yahoo, and when they search for their local library they should get accurate information back.
<p>Unfortunately, resources like Google Maps, Bing Maps, Yahoo Local, etc are a hodge-podge of data culled from social media properties like Google+ and FourSquare, drive-by edits, and attempted parses of the human-oriented markup on pages.
</p>
<p>Like it or not, this data is effectively considered authoritative; if Google Maps has the right name and location, but says your library is closed because it couldn't figure out the difference between your summer hours and your fall hours, then many people aren't going to make the extra effort to click through to double-check on your web page.</p>
<p>But we also want this data to be available to support applications that we haven't envisioned yet.</p>
<p>And we want to be present in the web of data.</p>

Over the summer, I have made some progress. On the education front, for those who prefer crisply written prose (thanks editors!), my recent article in The Partnership Journal walks step by step through the augmentation of an actual library website (hello, Greater Sudbury Public Library South Branch!) to include schema.org linked data, including location, contact info, opening hours, and event information.

I also believe that examples lower the barrier to adoption. To that end, I've taken the Library One-Pager website that influx.us created a few years back (with Amanda Etches) and created a branch that, in a 16-line diff, adds schema.org RDFa markup. You can see that live at http://coffeecode.ca/onepager and the code is on github at https://github.com/One-Pager (see the schema.org branch).
<p>
My hope is you can see how little change was required to make the Library One-Pager a publisher of linked open meta-institutional data and apply the same tactics to your own page.

I've also taken that One-Pager and converted it into a Drupal theme, with a handful of associated modules (as is the Drupal way), that builds on standard modules such as Opening Hours and Addressfield to create a schema.org-enhanced website. My goal was to prove that it should be possible to build a CMS template based on something reasonably rational that normal humans can use to set opening hours, contact information, etc, without having to even think about what's happening with schema.org under the covers; it should just work.
<p>
And it does. It's not perfect; a Drupal expert could probably clean up a lot of the rough edges pretty quickly, and all of the "tailor to your specific users and environment" warnings apply, but as a proof of concept I think it's a damn fine start.

                        <aside class="notes">
Here you can see a fairly standard Drupal content type that has a few text fields and an Addressfield embedded in it. A custom module (schema_address) modifies the HTML generated by the Addressfield module, while theme functions make the email and telephone fields do the right thing.

Adding basic schema.org metainstitutional data to your library website DOES NOT require a website redesign. You can probably slide this right into your existing website. Don't worry about all of the warts and blemishes in your current site; just close your eyes and add the RDFa (or microdata, or JSON-LD).
